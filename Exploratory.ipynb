    "### Functional boxplot\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a generalization of the univariate boxplot for functional data. The functional boxplot consists of a graph of the functional median (i.e., the deepest curve in the sample) surrounded by a central envelope, which encompasses the deepest $50\\%$ of the observations, and a maximum non-outlying envelope. The width of this outer envelope is determined by scaling the central one by a constant factor. This constant factor can be selected by the user. Its default value is $1.5$. In scikit-fda, the class **Boxplot** can be used to generate and customize functional boxplots. In this plot, a trajectory is marked as an outlier if it lies beyond the maximum non-outlying envelope for some interval. The class **BoxplotOutlierDetector** can be used for outlier detection based on this criterion. Some customizable elements of Boxplot objects are the depth measure, and the definition of centered bands that encompasses a user-specified fraction of the deepest observations. The following code provides an illustration of these functionalities with the *AEMET* dataset.\n",

The scikit-fda’s classes **Outliergram** and **OutliergramOutlierDetection** can be used to generate the outliergram and to detect outliers by using this criterion, respectively. "

In addition, if different plots are used for visual exploration of some functional dataset, selecting a particular curve in one plot highlights the corresponding curve in the other active plots.
